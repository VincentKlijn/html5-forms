# html5-web-forms
The HTML5 standard has been around for quite some years. In 2011 I did a test of the new web form elements to see what was and what was not supported by different browsers.

In August 2018 I repeated that test, to see what improvements had been made. The results actually were quite disappointing. I won't go as far to call this a failure, but the differences between browsers remain substantial. Frankly, Opera has the best support for the HTML5 Web Form specification.

This repo includes a series of simple html forms I used, each testing one functionality, an attribute, an input, or an element. Opening these files in different browser will illustrate support.

### The HTML
The HTML is heavily commented to make it easy to understand what HTML5 Web Form functionality is included.

### The CSS
The CSS is not really important for these demos; just some basic rules to establish formats.

### The JavaScript
There are several libraries that are loaded when needed. Most of these step in when browser support for the HTML5 functionality is missing.

Whenever needed, local JavaScript is added to the HTML file, to illustrate how this support is used. In real life, of course, code will be put in external files. All local JavaScript is heavily commented, almost on a line-by-line basis, explaining what is going on.
